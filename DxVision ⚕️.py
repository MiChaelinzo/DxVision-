These air sacs may fill with fluid, making it difficult to breathe.\n* **Severity Varies:** The severity of lung involvement can range from mild to critical. Some individuals may experience only mild symptoms, while others might require hospitalization and oxygen therapy.\n* **Long-Term Effects:** Some people who recover from COVID-19 pneumonia may experience long-term lung damage, such as scarring (pulmonary fibrosis) or decreased lung function.\n\n**Seeking Medical Attention:**\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, it's crucial to seek medical attention promptly. Early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve outcomes.\n\n**Remember, I cannot provide medical advice. This information is for general knowledge and educational purposes only.**\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n* **Privacy:** Sharing medical information online raises privacy concerns.
